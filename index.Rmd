## Import data

“Share of people who respond they are "very happy" or "rather happy" to the question "Taking all things together, would you say you are … ?"”

## 🔢 Table

```{r}
happiness %>% 
  filter(Year %in% c(2010, 2022)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = `percent_happy`, id_cols = Country) %>% 
  select(Country, `2010`, `2022`) %>% 
  mutate(`Absolute change` = round(`2022` - `2010`, 3)) %>% 
  mutate(`Relative change` = (`2022` - `2010`) / `2010`) %>% 
  reactable(
    columns = list(`Relative change` = colDef(format = colFormat(percent = TRUE, digits = 1))) 
  )
```

## 🌎 Map

```{r}
happiness %>% 
  mutate(`percent_happy` = round(`percent_happy`, 2)) %>%
  plot_geo(width = 940) %>% 
  add_trace(
    z = ~`percent_happy`,
    color = ~`percent_happy`,
    locations = ~Code,
    text = ~Country,
    frame = ~Year, colors = "YlGn"
  ) %>% 
  colorbar(title = NULL)
```


## 📈 Chart

```{r}
# simple line chart of the data, for five countries on different continents (ggplot, piped into ggplotly)

happiness_chart <- 
  happiness %>% 
  filter(Country %in% c("Sweden", "Brazil", "India", "Germany", "Argentina", "Russia", "Georgia", "Albania", "Zimbabwe")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `percent_happy`, color = Country)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), labels = function(x) paste0(x, "%")  # Append % sign to each y-axis label
  ) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL, 
       color = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() 

ggplotly(happiness_chart, width = 940)
```

## Advanced (Optional) 📈

The following chart demonstrates that it is possible to approximate the functionality of our World in Data grapher for multicountry selection using R, specifically with the `crosstalk` package and a small amount of custom JavaScript. For more information on how to achieve this, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67058016/how-to-set-default-values-in-filter-select-in-crosstalk-in-r-plotly).

Note that this is not a required task, but rather a showcase of what can be achieved. The code for this will be shared when we provide the solutions for the exercise.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(crosstalk)

# Crosstalk shared data
shared_happiness <- highlight_key(happiness)

happiness_plotly <- plot_ly(
  shared_happiness, 
  x = ~Year, 
  y = ~`percent_happy`, 
  color = ~Country, 
  type = "scatter", 
  mode = "lines+markers"
) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(range = c(0, 100)))


country_filter <- filter_select(
  "country_filter", 
  "Select a country to examine", 
  shared_happiness, 
  ~Country, 
  multiple = TRUE
)

bscols(
  list(country_filter, happiness_plotly)
)
```

<script>
function filter_default() {
  var default_countries = ["Sweden", "Brazil", "India", "Germany", "Argentina", "Russia", "Georgia", "Albania", "Zimbabwe"]; // Set default countries here
  document.getElementById("country_filter").getElementsByClassName("selectized")[0].selectize.setValue(default_countries, false);
}
window.onload = filter_default;
</script>
